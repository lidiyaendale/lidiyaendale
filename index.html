    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
      My name is Lidiya Endale, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a background in chemical pharmacy. I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, especially in healthcare and other sectors that drive societal change. I am currently expanding my skill set in Python, machine learning, data visualization, and artificial intelligence to better contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.
    <p>
      My academic journey started with a focus on health sciences, where I am currently pursuing my degree in chemical pharmacy at St. Lideta Lemaryam Health and Business College. This background gave me a strong understanding of the importance of data in decision-making and healthcare. I am continuously working to apply my technical background and my understanding of complex systems to the field of data science.
    </p>
    In addition to my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and project management. I’ve completed several online courses, including those in project management, virtual assistance, and various areas of healthcare and data science. I have worked on projects such as analyzing COVID-19 trends and am working toward building a platform for medical appointment scheduling and information dissemination <a href="http://alphappointiment.pages.dev" target="_blank">MSAID</a>.
